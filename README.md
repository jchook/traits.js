traits.js
=========

## What does traits.js do?

Traits.js makes it possible for you to have multiple inheritance pattern in your class structures.

With traits, you may continue to use the standard `all poodles are dogs` pattern, 
but you are no longer constrained to it. Now you can safely manage a modular inheritence network, 
which truly widens the possibilities for producing simple, [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) codebases.

## Why use traits.js instead of xyz?

* 42 lines of javascript, unminified
* Fully-featured and to-specification
* Use any javascript object as a Trait
* Simple. Convention over configuration

## What are some other features of traits.js?

* Be notified of name conflicts
* Resolve name conflicts expressly
* Understand the code in less than 10 minutes
* Require implementations to define specific properties
* Nest traits within other traits for good ol' class-style inheriance
* Allow traits to configure instance state via an explicit constructor callback
