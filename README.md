traits.js
=========

## What does traits.js do?

Traits.js makes it possible for you to have horizontal inheritance pattern in your class structures.

With traits, you may continue to use the vertical `this is a that` pattern, but you are no longer constrained to it. You may add as many traits as you like to an object, which truly widens the possibilities for producing simply [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) codebases.

## Why use traits.js instead of xyz?

* 42 lines of javascript, unminified
* Fully-featured and to-specification
* Use *any* javascript object as a Trait

## What are some other features of traits.js?

* Be notified of name conflicts
* Resolve name conflicts explicitly
* Understand the code in less than 10 minutes
* Require classes to implement specific methods
* Nest traits within other traits for good ol' vertical inheriance
* Control visibility of trait methods (public or private) 
* Optionally influence instance state w/ small plugin

## Show me some examples!

SOON!
